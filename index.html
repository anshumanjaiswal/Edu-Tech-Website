      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
        knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
        discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
        learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience
        that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology
        of teaching is called pedagogy.
        Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school,
        secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. </p>

      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is
        teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple
        students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed
        around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include
        curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher
        interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.
        The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical base to
        compare education systems. In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the fields were later
        separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by
        dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest level to cover a new
        sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3
        years.</p>

      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The education sector or education system is a group of institutions
        (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities,
        etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It
        involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses,
        students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.
        Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as
        education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as
        well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical
        (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the
        well-being of students when they are in school.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has
        found that schools tend to perform best</p>
